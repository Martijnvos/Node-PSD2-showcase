# ING Node.js PSD2 API showcase

## Used resources
This application makes use of the sandbox environment of ING's PSD2 API's.  
For access, the following OAuth 2.0 client_id is provided: ```5ca1ab1e-c0ca-c01a-cafe-154deadbea75```

ING also provided example certificates for singing the requests.  
These can be found in the ```certs``` folder.

## Documentation
Only the requests defined for the Sandbox API can be queried. Since the test profile selection screen shows multiple accounts I found it rather discieving.

If you want to call Account Information (AIS) API endpoints other than the ones in this demo you can have a look at the AIS documentation [here](https://developer.ing.com/static/AIS.pdf).
